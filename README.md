# Hand-Gesture-canvas

Finger Canvas is a real-time hand gesture–based drawing application built with **Python**, **MediaPipe**, and **OpenCV**.  
You can draw on the screen using **only your index finger**, just like an invisible pen in the air 🎨.

## 🧠 Gesture Logic

Drawing is enabled **only if**:
- Index finger is **up**
- Middle, Ring, and Pinky fingers are **down**
- Thumb is ignored

This ensures accurate and intentional drawing.
